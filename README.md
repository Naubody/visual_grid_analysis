## Voxel-wise visual-grid analysis on simulated data
(1) This code simulates beta estimates with a grid-like modulation (i.e.
a 6-fold rotational symmetry as a function of direction). (2) It then estimates
the orientation of the grid-modulation and (3) contrasts the corresponding beta
estimates in independent data. This procedure is cross-validated and control
symmetries are tested in addition. Each beta estimate represents one direction.
